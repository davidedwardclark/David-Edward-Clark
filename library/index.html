                    <p>Spent more hours on this than any other NES game. Gave me an appreciation for the action rpg genre. Excellent fighting system.</p>

                    <h3>Double Dragon</h3>
                    <p>The first great side-scrolling beat 'em up. Big colourful arcade graphics. Tough enemies. Countless quarters gone.</p>

                    <p>Deep gameplay kept me coming back. Loved the competitive aspect. The gold standard of 2D fighters that started it all.</p>

                    <p>Stunned at first. Frightening at times. Immersive &amp; graphic. Got me dreaming of 3D worlds &amp; VR headsets.</p>

                    <p>Underappreciated and in need of re-evaluation. The animation &amp; parrying mechanic alone make this a classic worth revisiting.</p>
