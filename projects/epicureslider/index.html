								<h2>The Story Behind Epicure&rsquo;s Saffron</h2>
								<p class="hyphenate"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t all started with a long trek Sylvie Rochette took in the Himalayan mountains in search of exotic ingredients for her next spice blend. She traveled through villages and along winding roads. One day she got lost. While trying to find her way back she came across a hidden farm situated far from the beaten path. There she discovered a family who had been growing saffron for hundreds of years. They could trace their ancestory to Alexander the Great who was said to have crossed the Himalayas with his troops on his way to India. The family sold the spice to surrounding villages who used it to cure ailments as well as flavour their food. The family asked Sylvie to stay and help them cultivate their fields of saffron but Sylvie declinded responding that she had an important task of delivering the best spice mixes in the world to Canadian families. Sylvie purchased many bundles of saffron from the family in grattitude of their hospitality. It took her many days to find her way out of the Himalayas but she finally made it to Kathmandu where she took a plane flight home. It is with great pleasure that Epicure offers you the world&rsquo;s rarest spice. Many mountains were crossed to bring this exotic flavour to your taste buds. <img src="img/fleuron.png" width="17" height="10" alt="The End" /></p>

								<h2>Epicure&rsquo;s Process</h2>
								<p class="hyphenate"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t Epicure we hand fill each jar with wholesome and organic herbs and spices. Our research and development team find the right balance to bring the best tastes to your mouth. The genius of our method is that we develop recipes alongside our products. This way we get real world testing and tasting through every step of the process. Epicure values the little things. We take care and pride in every step of the process. Offering you a vast array of quality products is our number one goal. Finding the best herbs &amp; spices in the world to put into our mixes is no easy task. Once we have an idea firmly conceptualised in the labs we make recipe after recipe to confirm whether it will be a contender or not. After a round of cooking our top notch testers are brought in from all over the world to see if their taste buds agree. If they do it is on to the next step; if not we start the entire process over again.</p>

							<div class="grid_3 col2">
								<p class="hyphenate">When they give the go ahead we know we have the green light to put that spice mix into production &mdash; but this is only the begining! First the mixers put their red suites on and begin adding ingredients to a giant bin. Next, a group of green suited &ldquo;stompers&rdquo; emerge and jump on the ingredients inside the bin. This human process of mixing gives a far better product than anything a machine could produce. The resulting batch of spice mix is once again tested by the taste testers. They verify it to make sure it meets the same quality levels established during the R&amp;D stage. If so the botteling process begins. This involves a team of blue suited workers who hand fill each jar with the contents from the bin. This process is tedious but results in a higher quality product. Next the jars are packaged up and ready to ship. Epicure brings you the greatest satisfaction with love added each step of the way. <img src="img/fleuron.png" width="17" height="10" alt="The End" /></p>

									<img src="img/quality/greenleaf.png" alt="two green leaves" class="icon" />
									<h2>Green Leaf</h2>
									<p class="hyphenate">Our high quality leaf comes from the forests of Brazil. Local natives are the only ones able to find it in the dense Amazon forest. They make a death defying journey that takes three weeks total to find their green leaf. It is delivered to Rio where traders ship it to Victoria. Here it goes through a curation process before use. <img src="img/fleuron.png" width="17" height="10" alt="The End" /></p>

								<div class="ingredient ginger">
									<img src="img/quality/ginger.png" alt="ginger root" class="icon" />
									<h2>Ginger Root</h2>
									<p class="hyphenate">Deep in the surrounding river banks of China&rsquo;s capital lies the fertile grounds where the sacred ginger root grows. Harvested only once a year it is a valuable commodity to the locals in the region who use it as a herbal remedy. Ginger is an important ingredient in many of Epicure&rsquo;s most important products. <img src="img/fleuron.png" width="17" height="10" alt="The End" /></p>
								</div>
								<div class="ingredient coriander">
									<img src="img/quality/coriander.png" alt="coriander seeds" class="icon" />
									<h2>Coriander Seeds</h2>
									<p class="hyphenate">Coriander seeds make there way into a number of Epicure&rsquo;s products, but how we get them is another story. They are harvested in the fields California, a compliment to the vineyards they often share space with. Coriander provides a unique flavor not found in any other spice and that is why we value it at Epicure. <img src="img/fleuron.png" width="17" height="10" alt="The End" /></p>
