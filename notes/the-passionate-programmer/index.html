    <h1>The Passionate Programmer</h1>
    <p>A series of quotes and paraphrases from The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The people around you effect your performance. Choose your crowd wisely.</li>
      <li>You can&rsquo;t be remarkable if you don&rsquo;t love your environment, tools, and domain.</li>
      <li>It&rsquo;s always surprising how wrong the first version of a chapter can be and how right a good reviewer can make it.</li>
      <li>Business domain knowledge is important: the business pays your salary.</li>
      <li>Invest in a business domain: restaurants, real estate, tourism etc.</li>
      <li>When ever you want to learn about something, write about it.</li>
      <li>Talk to the rubber ducky when your stuck.</li>
      <li>Studying the work of masters is essential to becoming a master.</li>
      <li>Align with your teams goals and make your manager look good.</li>
      <li>Think about what it costs a company to hire you. Are you worth it?</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t get too comfortable. Wake up everyday and tell yourself: this could be it.</li>
      <li>The more successful you are the more likely you are to make a fatal mistake. Be humble, always.</li>
      <li>Maintenance is just as important as starting fresh, and usually cheaper.</li>
      <li>Saying yes all the time is an addictive &amp; destructive habit. Learn when to say no.</li>
      <li>Have the strength to say no to a manager or a client when necessary and they will appreciate and trust your yes&rsquo;s more.</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t panic.</li>
      <li>Physical proximity is an advantage in the work place.</li>
      <li>Hang with those who are good at what you want to be good at.</li>
      <li>Predict the next technology and learn it ahead of time.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the act of doing things &ndash; don&rsquo;t just think about getting them done.</li>
    </ul>
