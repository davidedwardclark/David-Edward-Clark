    <h1>Only Keep the Books You Love</h1>
    <p>I try to own as few physical things as possible because it allows me to live in a small space and easily move if necessary. I also love to read books, which means I would end up with a lot of them if I didn't buy most in a digital format. To get around the problem of owning too many physical books I follow a decision tree which allows me to figure out what type of book format I should choose. The decision tree favours books in a digital format which keeps to a minimum the total amount of physical books I own.</p>
    <p>So, let's say I want to read a book. The first thing I do is find out if the book contains diagrams, which are typically books on visual design. If this isn't the case I get the book in audio format. If I can't find it in audio I buy it in an ebook form. Roughly three quarters of all books I buy are digital - mostly in audio form, and the rest as ebooks.</p>
    <p>Alternatively if a book contains diagrams that I have to see I look for the highest quality print version available. I'll take a hardcover over softcover, and the most beautiful and newest edition I can find. If a softcover is all there is then I buy that as they can be very well designed.</p>

    <p>If I need to see the diagrams in a book but there isn't an aesthetically pleasing physical version available I get it in a digital format. I'll look for it on Amazon Kindle or a PDF copy if I can find it. These take up no physical space so they don't go against my principle of owning as few physical things as possible.</p>
    <p>Once I'm done reading the book if it is hard or softcover I decide if I like it. Would I read it again and again? Is it a timeless classic? If so I hold on to it. Examples: Elements of Colour, Grid Systems in Graphic Design, CODEX: The Journal of Typography. Otherwise I sell it or give it to a friend. If it is in a digital format I archive it regardless if I like it or not.</p>
    <p>Applying this system has resulted in me owning only a small amount of beautifully designed physical books. The rest are in an audio or ebook format.</p>
