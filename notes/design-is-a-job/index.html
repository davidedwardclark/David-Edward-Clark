    <h1>Design is a Job</h1>
    <p>A series of quotes and paraphrases from Design is a Job by Mike Monteiro.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A designer solves problems within a set of constraints.</li>
      <li>A designer understands goals, gathers information &amp; imposes order.</li>
      <li>The work starts before a single pixel is placed.</li>
      <li>Clients are looking for confidence.</li>
      <li>Lack of clients is the number one reason studios fail.</li>
      <li>Be pleasant to work with, do good work.</li>
      <li>All successful jobs lead to more jobs.</li>
      <li>Be pleasant, don&rsquo;t be nice.</li>
      <li>How a client behaves at the start is how they will behave later on.</li>
      <li>Trust your gut.</li>
      <li>Walk away from clients who don&rsquo;t listen and just want an implementer.</li>
      <li>Don&rsquo;t work with people who show up begrudgingly and dont value design.</li>
      <li>Work for money!</li>
      <li>Charge as much as you can.</li>
      <li>You can always negotiate down a high price. You can&rsquo;t go up from a low price.</li>
      <li>Break down your bill into the services your charging for.</li>
      <li>Never compete with the client to solve the problem.</li>
      <li>Present your work or you are not a designer. Keep at it and you&rsquo;ll get better.</li>
      <li>End a presentation on time. Anwser everyones questions.</li>
      <li>Never speak ill of your clients.</li>
      <li>Lawyers talk to lawyers.</li>
      <li>Always have a contract.</li>
      <li>The larger the project the more often you should invoice.</li>
    </ul>
